/**
 * Arrow Functions:
 *  - Shorthand for anon Functions
 *  - if there's only one param, drop ()
 *  - if only one line, drop {} and return
 *  - only difference between => and normal is that => 
 * DO NOT CHANGE THE VALUE OF THIS  
 * 
 * Default Parameters:
 *  - You can give params a default value in the function line
 *  - If you don't call the param within the function
 * it will be called based on default value
 * 
 * Template Literals:
 *  - use back ticks instead of quotes
 *  - use {} to frame parameters/variables
 * Shorthand Function Properties:
 *  - in order to still use 'this' with anon fucntions
 *  - red: function () {} would be red() {}
 *  - only works on properties that are funtions!
 * 
 * Destructuring:
 *  - const phone = '860 459 2588';
 *  - const [area, first, last] = phone.split(' ');
 *  - console.log(area) will log: '860'
 * 
 *  - function showPerson ({ name, age, hometown })
 *  - console.log(name);
 *  - const person = {name: 'Jan', age: 18, hometown: 'Greenbow, AL'};
 * 
 * Const:
 *  - alternative to let
 *  - makes a variable 'constant' and unable to be reassigned 
 *  - it dos NOT make a variable unchangable, it makes it un-reassignable
